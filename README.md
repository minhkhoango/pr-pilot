## The Problem: The Great War of the PR

#### Overall Summary  
This PR introduces a new `JsonStore` class for handling session data with JSON persistence.  
It also refactors `BaseStore` to be more generic and updates `main.py` to use this new storage mechanism.

---

#### üóÇÔ∏è File-by-File Breakdown  
- **`src/storage.py`**  
  - **Added:** `JsonStore` class  
    - `__init__`: Loads initial data and sets file path  
    - `set(key, value)`: Adds/updates key-value pairs  
    - `get(key)`: Retrieves a value by key  
    - `save()`: Persists session data to JSON  
  - **Modified:** `BaseStore` simplified into a minimal abstract template  

- **`src/main.py`**  
  - **Modified:** Now instantiates `JsonStore` for session management  

---

#### üö® Risk Assessment  
- **Medium Risk:** `JsonStore.save()` writes directly to disk with no error handling. Disk failures or permission issues could cause data loss.  
- **Low Risk:** Swap in `main.py` is straightforward; as long as `JsonStore` follows the expected interface, regression risk is minimal.
