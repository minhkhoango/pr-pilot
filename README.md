# PR-Pilot

PR-Pilot is an ultra-simple MVP I made over the weekends to address a problem I call "the great war of PR style," discussed in the [Theatre of Pull Requests and Code Review](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45371283) thread on Hacker News.

To see the GitHub action in action, go to https://github.com/minhkhoango/pr-pilot-sandbox and make any pull request!

## What it does

PR-Pilot reads the raw diff (generated by `git diff`) and pastes a concise summary directly to the PR thread. 

## Quick Start

### 1. Create the Workflow File

In your repository, create a new file at `.github/workflows/pr-pilot.yml` and paste the following content:

```yml
name: "PR-Pilot Briefing"

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  briefing:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run PR-Pilot analysis
        uses: minhkhoango/pr-pilot@v1.0.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GOOGLE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY }}
```

### 2. Add API Key

This MVP uses the Google Gemini API.

1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and get your API key.
2.  In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
3.  Click **New repository secret**.
4.  Name the secret `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
5.  Paste your API key into the value field and save.

### 3. Open a Pull Request

That's it!

## Known Limitations

- This MVP is a basic LLM wrapper around a `git diff` command, and uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite by default. In simple terms, its accuracy and understanding sucks and serve mostly as a proof of concept. 
- The summary fails to see the forest for the trees, meaning for big, multi-file changes, it will have no clue if the major changes all serve a single purpose (i.e, from TensorFlow to PyTorch)
